# Hasher

Hasher is a Clojure library for manipulating fixed-size hash maps using arrays.

Linear probing is employed for hash collisions but remains untested.

I wrote this, and then I forgot that I wrote it, which should show you how
insignificant this project is to me. Nonetheless, it was a useful endeavor, so
here it is.
