# Hasher

Hasher is a Clojure library for manipulating fixed-size hash maps using arrays.
Linear probing is employed for hash collisions but remains untested.

I wrote this, and then I forgot I wrote it, which shows you how insignificant
this project is to me. Nonetheless, it was a useful endeavor, so here it is.
